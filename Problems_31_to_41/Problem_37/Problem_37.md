# Problem 37
### Difficulty: medium
Calculate Euler's totient function phi(m) (improved).
See problem 34 for the definition of Euler's totient function. If the list of the prime factors of a number m is known in the form of problem 36 then the function phi(m) can be efficiently calculated as follows: Let ((p1 m1) (p2 m2) (p3 m3) ...) be the list of prime factors (and their multiplicities) of a given number m. Then phi(m) can be calculated with the following formula:
Note that a ** b stands for the b'th power of a.
