# Problem 11
### Difficulty: easy
Modified run-length encoding.
Modify the result of problem 10 in such a way that if an element has no duplicates it is simply copied into the result list. Only elements with duplicates are transferred as (N E) lists.

Example:

```

* (encode-modified '(a a a a b c c a a d e e e e))
((4 A) B (2 C) (2 A) D (4 E))
```
Example in Haskell:

```
Î»> encodeModified "aaaabccaadeeee"
[Multiple 4 'a',Single 'b',Multiple 2 'c',
 Multiple 2 'a',Single 'd',Multiple 4 'e']
```
