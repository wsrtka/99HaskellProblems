# Problem 47
### Difficulty: easy
Truth tables for logical expressions (2).
Continue problem P46 by defining and/2, or/2, etc as being operators. This allows to write the logical expression in the more natural way, as in the example: A and (A or not B). Define operator precedence as usual; i.e. as in Java.

Example:

```

* (table A B (A and (A or not B)))
true true true
true fail true
fail true fail
fail fail fail
```
Example in Haskell:

```
Î»> table2 (\a b -> a `and'` (a `or'` not b))
True True True
True False True
False True False
False False False
```
