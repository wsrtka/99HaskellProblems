Gray codes.
An n-bit Gray code is a sequence of n-bit strings constructed according to certain rules. For example,
Find out the construction rules and write a predicate with the following specification:
Can you apply the method of "result caching" in order to make the predicate more efficient, when it is to be used repeatedly?

Example in Haskell:

```
Î»> gray 3
["000","001","011","010","110","111","101","100"]
```
