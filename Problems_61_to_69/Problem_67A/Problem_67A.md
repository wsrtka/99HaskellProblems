# Problem 67A
### Difficulty: 
A string representation of binary trees
Somebody represents binary trees as strings of the following type:
a) Write a Prolog predicate which generates this string representation, if the tree is given as usual (as nil or t(X,L,R) term). Then write a predicate which does this inverse; i.e. given the string representation, construct the tree in the usual form. Finally, combine the two predicates in a single predicate tree_string/2 which can be used in both directions.

Example in Prolog

```

?- tree_to_string(t(x,t(y,nil,nil),t(a,nil,t(b,nil,nil))),S).
S = 'x(y,a(,b))'
?- string_to_tree('x(y,a(,b))',T).
T = t(x, t(y, nil, nil), t(a, nil, t(b, nil, nil)))
```
Example in Haskell:

```
λ> stringToTree "x(y,a(,b))" >>= print
Branch 'x' (Branch 'y' Empty Empty) (Branch 'a' Empty (Branch 'b' Empty Empty))
λ> let t = cbtFromList ['a'..'z'] in stringToTree (treeToString t) >>= print . (== t)
True
```
