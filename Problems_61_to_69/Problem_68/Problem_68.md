# Problem_68
### Difficulty: 
Preorder and inorder sequences of binary trees. We consider binary trees with nodes that are identified by single lower-case letters, as in the example of problem P67.
a) Write predicates preorder/2 and inorder/2 that construct the preorder and inorder sequence of a given binary tree, respectively. The results should be atoms, e.g. 'abdecfg' for the preorder sequence of the example in problem P67.
b) Can you use preorder/2 from problem part a) in the reverse direction; i.e. given a preorder sequence, construct a corresponding tree? If not, make the necessary arrangements.
c) If both the preorder sequence and the inorder sequence of the nodes of a binary tree are given, then the tree is determined unambiguously. Write a predicate pre_in_tree/3 that does the job.

Example in Haskell:

```
Î»> let { Just t = stringToTree "a(b(d,e),c(,f(g,)))" ;
         po = treeToPreorder t ;
         io = treeToInorder t } in preInTree po io >>= print
Branch 'a' (Branch 'b' (Branch 'd' Empty Empty) (Branch 'e' Empty Empty)) (Branch 'c' Empty (Branch 'f' (Branch 'g' Empty Empty) Empty))
```
