# Problem_61A
### Difficulty: 
Collect the leaves of a binary tree in a list
A leaf is a node with no successors. Write a predicate leaves/2 to collect them in a list.

Example:

```

% leaves(T,S) :- S is the list of all leaves of the binary tree T
```
Example in Haskell:

```
λ> leaves tree4
[4,2]
```
