# Problem_62
### Difficulty: 
Collect the internal nodes of a binary tree in a list 
An internal node of a binary tree has either one or two non-empty successors. Write a predicate internals/2 to collect them in a list. 

Example:

```

% internals(T,S) :- S is the list of internal nodes of the binary tree T.
```
Example in Haskell:

```
λ> internals tree4
[1,2]
```
