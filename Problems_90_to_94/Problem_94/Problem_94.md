# Problem 94
### Difficulty: hard
Generate K-regular simple graphs with N nodes
In a K-regular graph all nodes have a degree of K; i.e. the number of edges incident in each node is K. How many (non-isomorphic!) 3-regular graphs with 6 nodes are there?

Example in Haskell:

```
Î»> length $ regular 6 3
2
```
