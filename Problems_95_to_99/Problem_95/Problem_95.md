# Problem_95
### Difficulty: medium
English number words
On financial documents, like cheques, numbers must sometimes be written in full words. Example: 175 must be written as one-seven-five. Write a predicate full-words/1 to print (non-negative) integer numbers in full words.

Example in Haskell:

```
Î»> fullWords 175
one-seven-five
```
