### Difficulty: medium
Depth-first order graph traversal (alternative solution)
Write a predicate that generates a depth-first order graph traversal sequence. The starting point should be specified, and the output should be a list of nodes that are reachable from this starting point (in depth-first order).

Example in Haskell:

```
λ> depthFirst ([1,2,3,4,5,6,7], [(1,2),(2,3),(1,4),(3,4),(5,2),(5,4),(6,7)]) 1
[1,2,3,4,5]
```
