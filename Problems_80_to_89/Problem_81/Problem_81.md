### Difficulty: medium
Path from one node to another one
Write a function that, given two nodes a and b in a graph, returns all the acyclic paths from a to b.

Example in Haskell:

```
λ> paths 1 4 [(1,2),(2,3),(1,3),(3,4),(4,2),(5,6)]
[[1,2,3,4],[1,3,4]]
λ> paths 2 6 [(1,2),(2,3),(1,3),(3,4),(4,2),(5,6)]
[]
```
